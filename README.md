This repository exists to capture the latest and most stable builds for our use.

Features
- Drop-in replacement for std::string
- Very Lightweight ~2k LOC
- Very Fast
- sizeof(utf8_string) = 24bytes (x86)
- Codepoint Range: 0x0 - 0x7FFFFFFF (6 Bytes)
- Single Header file, Single Source file
- NO Exceptions (Defensive Programming)
- Straightforward C++11 design
- Even Understands ANSI Strings (Characters 127-255) (with the above mentioned limitations)
- Prepend the UTF8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) to any string when converting it to an std::string
- Supports raw (Byte-based) access (where Speed is needed)

WHAT TINY-UTF8 DOES NOT:
- conversion between iso encodings and utf8
- other unicode encodings like UTF16 or UTF32
- visible character comparison ('ch' vs. 'c'+'h')
- codepoint normalization
